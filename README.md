# Better Repair
This is a basic /repair plugin with a few more features. The main feature is that it works with modded items!

Has configurable options to disable an entire mod as well as individual items! Items that can't be repaired (such as blocks) never will so don't worry about those modded items!

**Commands & Permissions:**  
/repair -- Repairs current item -- betterrepair.repair  
/repair all -- Repairs all items including armor -- betterrepair.repairall  
/br add -- Adds current item to non-repairable list -- betterrepair.add  
/br remove -- Removes current item from non-repairable list -- betterrepair.remove  
/br reload -- Reloads config -- betterrepair.reload  
/br ? -- Lists current commands
